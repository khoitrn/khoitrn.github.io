    <h2>Your Learning</h2>
    <p>
      So far I loved learned about IAM, cloud service models, and the AWS Shared Responsibility Model. 
      IAM provides fine-grained control over who can access resources and what actions they can take. I learned the
      differences between <strong>users</strong>, <strong>groups</strong>, and <strong>roles</strong>, and how JSON IAM policies implement the principle of least privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      We compared cloud service models: with <strong>IaaS</strong>, customers manage more (OS, runtime, apps) in exchange for maximum control. 
      I also looked at <strong>serverless (AWS Lambda)</strong>—often grouped with PaaS/FaaS—which reduces operational burden by managing the underlying 
      infrastructure so I can focus on code, data, and permissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>AWS Shared Responsibility Model</strong> clarified “security <em>of</em> the cloud” (AWS secures data centers, networking, hardware) versus 
      “security <em>in</em> the cloud” (customers configure and secure what they run). I practiced securing data with encryption at rest and in transit, 
      reviewed correct S3 bucket access configurations, and saw how services like <strong>AWS Artifact</strong> and <strong>AWS Config</strong> support compliance and governance.

      My primary focus is <strong>AI Security</strong>. I’m currently working through a course called <em>AI Security Fundamentals</em> by Security Ignite
      to strengthen my baseline in topics like model and data threats, prompt and jailbreak defenses, secure deployment patterns, and monitoring.
      I’m especially interested in practical guardrails, evaluation strategies, supply-chain hygiene, and how to apply classic security concepts
      (threat modeling, least privilege, defense-in-depth) to modern AI systems and workflows.

    <h2>Hobbies / Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I love sports—playing, watching, and following highlights. Outside of sports, I read regularly; right now I’m reading a book called 
      <em>AI in Security</em> to connect technical concepts with real-world case studies. I enjoy learning, building small projects, and sharing what I
      pick up with friends and classmates.
